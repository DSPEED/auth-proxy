{"tagline":"Check incoming frontend request against your API to see if a user is logged in","body":"# Purpose of this module\r\nThis **Node.js module** is made for a scenario where you use Node.js and separate frontend from the API. For incoming requests we need to know if the user is logged in and what rights (s)he has.\r\n\r\n# Where it runs\r\nThe module runs on your frontend server and enables you to specify a URL that will be called. You can pass along a function that will be called to ensure that the user is valid (i.e. check the response from the API).\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nI am a novice Node programmer, so feedback is more than welcome. It would be great to have some collaborators on this project. Also, do not rely on this code if you're a newbie too.","google":"","name":"Auth-proxy","note":"Don't delete this file!
